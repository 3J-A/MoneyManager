# Money Manager 

Money Manager is a web application that aids users in budgeting and financing their wallets. A personal budget tracker where you can manage and track your spendings and savings. This application takes in your monthly income and computes any expenses, bills, and subscriptions you may have to see how much you have left over. From there on, you may accumulate them into savings or pay off any loans or debt.
