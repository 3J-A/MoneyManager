# Money Manager 

Money Manager is a web application that aids users in budgeting and financing their wallets. A personal budget tracker where you can manage and track your spendings and savings. This application takes in your monthly income and computes any expenses, bills, and subscriptions you may have to see how much you have left over. From there on, you may accumulate them into savings or pay off any loans or debt.

## Developer Notes

MoneyManager was a collaborative project we worked on in a Software Quality Assurance course in the Summer 2023 semester at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa. One of the challenges we faced was the time constraint of this project; due to the course being a summer class, we only had 6 weeks to come up with the concept for the website, and its design, then implement it, and deploy it. There are a couple of features that we intended to implement but had to remove from the final version due to the limitation of time. However, we are proud that we were able to develop a security-oriented website that includes the majority of functionalities that we listed in the first week and learn the fundamentals of the Secure Development Life Cycle in the process.
